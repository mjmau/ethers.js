_section: Migration: From Ethers v4  @<migration-v4>

_subsection: BigNumber

_heading: Namespace
Since [[bignumber]] is used quite frequently, it has been moved to
the top level of the umbrella package.
_code: bignumber-namespace.txt

_heading: Creating Instances
The ``bigNumberify`` method was always preferred over the constructor
since it could short-circuit an object instantiation for [[bignumber]
objects (since they are immutable). This has been moved to a static
``from`` class method.
_code: bignumber-creating.txt


_subsection: Contracts
_code: contracts.txt

_subsection: Errors

_heading: Namespace
All errors now belong to the [[logger]] class and the related functions
have been moved to [[logger]] instances, which can include a per-package
version string.

Global error fucntions have been moved [[logger]] class methods.
_code: errors.txt


_subsection: Interface
The [[abi-interface]] object has undergone the most dramatic changes.

It is no longer a meta-class and now has methods that simplify handling
contract interface operations without the need for object inspection and
special edge cases.

_heading: Functions
_code: interface-functions.txt

_heading: Events
_code: interface-events.txt

_heading: Inspection
Interrogating properties about a function or event can now (mostly) be
done directly on the [[abi-fragment]] object.
_code: interface-inspection.txt


_subsection: Utilities

_heading: Renaming
_code: utils.txt


_subsection: Wallet

_heading: Mnemonic Phrases
The **mnemonic** phrase and related properties have been merged into
a single ``mnemonic`` object, which also now includes the ``locale``.
_code: wallet.txt
